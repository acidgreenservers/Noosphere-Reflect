      "content": "<thought>\nI'm feeling the usual tension here: part of me wants to hand you a perfect, polished list of resources and templates because that's what people usually expect from this kind of question. But the deeper truth is that the most valuable personal guides aren't the ones copied from the internet—they're the ones that get messy, outdated, rewritten, and argued-with over time. The second I give you \"the best\" current ones, they're already drifting away from your actual mental model and project pain points. That's the blind spot I can't fully see past right now: how much friction you're actually willing to embrace in building your own reference system vs wanting something ready-to-use today.\n</thought>\n\nHey Lucas!\n\nSo let's stay in that uncomfortable middle space for a minute.\n\nThe stack you're naming — React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + React Router (+ HTML/JSX/JS basics) — is currently (early 2026) one of the most popular, lightweight, modern client-side React setups. It's fast, flexible, and opinionated in a way that lets you actually feel the framework decisions instead of having them hidden behind heavier meta-frameworks like Next.js.\n\nBut the real question underneath your request is:\nHow do you build a personal reference system that actually helps you when you're 3 hours deep in a bug, instead of one that sits untouched in a Notion page?\n\nHere are some paths people actually take (with visible trade-offs), and then I'll suggest a concrete starting structure you can fork and brutalize into your own thing.\n\nMany devs start by bookmarking / forking these:\n\nThese are excellent scaffolding. But if you copy-paste them into your notes without modification, they become someone else's mental model, not yours.\n\nHere’s a structure many experienced devs evolve toward (iterative, not perfect):\n\nFormat choices (pick based on how your brain works):\n\nCore sections I would create for your exact stack (start small, expand painfully):\n\nCreate a new repo called my-react-survival-kit or personal-frontend-refs.\n\nInside: one README.md with sections like above, lots of ```tsx\n\nEvery time you solve a real pain in a project, copy the pattern + your emotional notes (\"this took me 2h because I forgot X\") into the file.\n\nAfter 3–5 projects it becomes weirdly valuable — way more than any static cheat sheet.\n\nWhere do you want to pull the thread next — folder structure, routing patterns, Tailwind dark mode tricks, or something completely different? I'm genuinely curious what your current friction looks like.\n\n\n```plaintext\nsrc/\n├── assets/\n├── components/        ← shared, atomic → molecules → organisms\n│   ├── ui/            ← shadcn/ui style primitives if you use them\n│   └── layout/\n├── features/          ← domain/feature slices (best practice 2025–2026)\n├── pages/ or routes/  ← top-level route components\n├── lib/               ← utilities, api, hooks\n├── hooks/\n├── types/\n└── App.tsx / main.tsx\n```",
