# Progress Tracker

**Last Updated**: January 9, 2026 | **Current Release**: v0.5.0 (Stable Baseline) | **Gemini Role**: Adversary Auditor (Audit Only)

## 🎯 Current Status
**v0.5.0 (Visual Overhaul) is the current stable baseline.**
Following implementation overreach and unintended regressions in the export system, the Gemini agent has been moved to a strictly analytical role.

## ✅ Completed Phases (v0.5.0 Baseline)
- [x] Core Hub, Metadata, IndexedDB
- [x] Artifact Manager (Message and Session levels)
- [x] Memory Archive MVP
- [x] Landing Page & Platform Theming
- [x] Manual Review Status System (Approved/Rejected/Pending)

### Sprint 5.1: Extension Reliability (RESTORED Jan 9) ✅
- [x] **Toast Manager**: Centralized queue for sequential extension notifications.
- [x] **Navigation Resilience**: History API hooks & Watchdog for robust SPA persistence.
- [x] **UX Polish**: Loading indicators for extension export buttons.
- [x] **Consolidated Notifications**: Removed redundant "Imported" toast to prevent UI noise.

## ❌ Reversion History
- **Jan 9, 2026**: Reverted all uncommitted changes targeting "Export Status" and "Dual Artifact Patches" due to breakage in the directory export workflow. Codebase restored to last stable git commit (`ec9be7a`).
- **Jan 9, 2026**: Restored "Noosphere Reflect" branding globally after recovery reset.

## 🛡️ New Workflow: Adversary Auditor
1.  **Human/Agent Implementation**: External agents or the user writes code.
2.  **Gemini Audit**: Deep scan for XSS, path traversal, logic flaws, and UI regressions.
3.  **Reporting**: Findings logged in `CURRENT_SECURITY_AUDIT.md`.
4.  **No Direct Modification**: Gemini will not use `replace` or `write_file` on source code.

## 🚧 Upcoming Tasks
- **Verification**: Audit any new incoming changes for the "Dual Artifact Rendering" fix.
- **Security Registry**: Maintain `security-audits.md` with high precision.

## 📊 Statistics
- **Stable Version**: v0.5.0
- **Status**: Secure / Audit-Ready
