# Product Context

## Why this project exists
AI chat logs are ephemeral, scattered across platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.), and difficult to organize for long-term reference. Existing export options are often limited or rely on proprietary formats.

**AI Chat Archival System** provides a high-fidelity, standalone, and privacy-focused way to scrape, refine, and archive conversations into a centralized hub that is perfect for Git-based backups.

## Problems it solves
1.  **Platform Fragmentation**: Consolidates chats from various AI providers into a single, unified format.
2.  **Ephemerality**: Prevents loss of valuable insights by converting dynamic web views into permanent, offline-viewable files.
3.  **UI Data Loss**: Captures "thoughts," artifacts, and structured data that basic copy-pasting misses.
4.  **Lack of Organization**: Adds metadata (titles, tags, models) that AI platforms don't inherently provide for exports.
5.  **Git Incompatibility**: Standardizes formats (Markdown/JSON) to allow for clear version history and diff tracking in repositories.

## User Experience Goals
- **Effortless Ingestion**: Surgical HTML parsing and a future Chrome extension "bridge."
- **Full Creative Control**: Inline editing of messages and metadata to "perfect" the archive before final export.
- **Visual Excellence**: A premium, "studio-like" dashboard for managing the library.
- **Portability**: Standalone output that looks identical to the original chat but works anywhere without an internet connection.
