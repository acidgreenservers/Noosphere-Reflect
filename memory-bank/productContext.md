# Product Context

## Why this project exists
Users frequently interact with AI LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) and want to save these conversations in a readable, sharable format. Raw Markdown or JSON exports are often hard to read for non-technical users. This tool bridges that gap by converting these logs into beautiful, styled, offline HTML web pages.

## Problems it solves
1.  **Readability**: Transforms raw text into chat-bubble layouts.
2.  **Portability**: Creates single-file HTML outputs that work anywhere (no server needed).
3.  **Preservation**: Allows users to archive "thought processes" and code blocks with syntax highlighting.
4.  **Complexity Management**: The new "AI Mode" solves the issue of messy/unstructured logs by using an LLM to parse them intelligently.

## User Experience Goals
- **"Wowed" First Impression**: The UI should feel premium, modern, and high-tech (Glassmorphism, dark mode).
- **Clear Separation**: Users should immediately understand the choice between "Quick/Offline" (Basic) and "Smart/Rich" (AI).
- **Seamless Flow**: From paste -> convert -> preview -> download should be frictionless.
