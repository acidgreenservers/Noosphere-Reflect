my ultimate goal for this application is a full on chat archival system where i can import my chats, export as html, md or json. to keep in a git repo. 
where i can have all the html files referenced from a main website. so they can all be organized and read from a single site. 
this is my vision for my endgoal of the application. 

my overall featureset vision is, i would like to be able to have a realtime connection to the chat i am having currently, with 2 buttons next to the user chat entry. cancel and export to app.
users can individually check user or ai messages for granularity, or just a select all from a droop down in the export button. 

once the user exports to the application, its saves to local storage in the application where the user can edit the messages, add the links to the files that were created, edit chat metadata, then export to either markdown, json or html. 

a full archival system for git repo archiving of ai chats.
